			"question": "What is the difference between first-, second-, and third-degree burns?",
			"answer": "First-degree burns are red and painful. They swell a little and turn white when you press on them. The skin over the burn may peel off in a day or two. This is the least severe type of burn, affecting only the outer layer of skin. Second-degree burns have blisters and are painful. They affect both the outer and thicker middle layer of skin. Third-degree burns cause damage to all layers of the skin. The burned skin looks white or charred. These burns may cause little or no pain if nerves are damaged."

			"question": "What causes acne?",
			"answer": "The exact cause of acne is not known, but one important factor is an increase in hormones called androgens. These male sex hormones increase in both boys and girls during puberty.

Acne is not caused by chocolate or other kinds of foods."
