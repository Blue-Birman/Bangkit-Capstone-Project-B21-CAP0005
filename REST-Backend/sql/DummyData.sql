    'Does Aspirin Increase Your Risk of Skin Cancer?', 
    'Aspirin is among the most commonly used medications in the world. It is used over the counter to treat common causes of pain such as headaches.
Skin cancer is among the most common of all cancers across the world. Three major types account for much of this cancer burden, namely, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma (MM).
Low-dose aspirin is used to reduce the chances of blood clots in the heart; a condition linked to heart attacks, stroke and other disorders. However, the daily use of aspirin is associated with a host of side effects.
Gastritis is quite common, but in severe cases peptic ulceration may occur, which could cause bleeding into the stomach, brain or intestine. Such bleeding may often be profuse or occur in critical areas, and may then endanger the patient’s life.

Aspirin and skin cancer
Aspirin inhibits the enzymes cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and 2. COX-2 regulates inflammation via prostaglandin synthesis, and is thought to control the development and progression of cancers. The inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis-mediated inflammation by aspirin is hypothesized to prevent malignancies by this mechanism. It has been postulated that this decreased risk could be related to increased COX-2 expression in squamous cell carcinoma.
However, the evidence regarding the link between aspirin and cancer risk is far from clear. According to one meta-analysis from 2015, aspirin was shown to be associated with a decreased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer but not melanoma. In 2018, a new study showed that men, but not women, with a 1-year or more history of aspirin use had an increased risk of melanoma.
In the 2018 study, conducted in the US, researchers gathered data on all patients treated at a large city hospital in Chicago with the following characteristics: the patients were between 18 and 89 years of age, had no history of MM, and had aspirin once a day for at least one year. These patients were followed up for five years or more. The researchers looked at the daily dose used, whether 81 mg (low dose) or 325 mg (typical dose), with other demographic characteristics, and for the development of malignant melanoma after one or more years of first seeing the patient.
The researchers concluded that taking aspirin once a day increases the overall melanoma risk, independent of the dose. Men had an 83% increased risk of developing melanoma, but there was no increased among risk among women.
One reason for the difference between results for men and women could be that protective enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase and catalase, are expressed at lower levels in males, compared with females. These lower levels suggest that a higher level of oxidative cellular damage might occur as a result of chronic aspirin exposure in men, which might contribute to the possibility of developing melanoma.

How will aspirin affect my risk of developing skin cancer?
Known risk factors for melanoma include sun exposure, fair skin, sunburn or tanning, a family history of skin cancer, ultraviolet exposure, and multiple moles. In recent times, the incidence of MM has gone up in the US.
Because the evidence is conflicting regarding aspirin use and skin cancer development, people should focus on well-established prevention for skin cancer. Covering up and consistent sunscreen use when exposed to the sun are the best methods by which to protect the skin from skin cancer and other short-term and long-term effects of sun exposure.
The evidence is not clear enough at this time to make a recommendation regarding aspirin intake and skin cancer risk. Aspirin use should be based on other factors, especially history of cardiovascular disease.', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

    'One of the major risk factors for skin cancer is exposure to the sun’s harmful UV rays. The best method for prevention of skin cancer is to protect oneself from such exposure.
Steps and measures to reduce sun exposure include the following;

Seeking shade
To limit sun exposure one should avoid being in direct sunlight for too long. This is particularly important between the hours of 10 am and 4 pm when the UV light is at its strongest.
A simple shadow test may be applied to check the directness and intensity of the sun. If one’s shadow is shorter than their body size the sun’s rays are the strongest and protection is necessary. The UV rays become more intense in the spring before temperatures get warmer and people may get sunburns before summer sets in mainly because they fail to protect themselves.
Areas with snow, sand (beaches), water etc. increase UV exposure due to reflected light and more protection is needed. UV rays can also reach below the water’s surface, pass through windows, windshields etc. Before venturing outdoors the UV index may be checked in the local newspaper, TV, radio, and online forecasts. It is also available on the EPA’s web site at www.epa.gov/sunwise/uvindex.html and in a variety of smartphone apps.
Sun protection of an individual
A simple way of sun-protecting oneself is to go the Australian “Slip! Slop! Slap! Slide” way. Here the words mean Slip on a shirt, Slop on sunscreen, Slap on a hat and Slide on sunglasses to protect the eyes and sensitive skin around them.Slop, Slap, Seek and Slide - Sid the Seagull Video

Clothing
Each of these measures protects against sun’s UV rays. For example, one should wear clothing that covers as much of the body as possible. Long-sleeved shirts, long pants, or skirts cover the most skin and are the most protective. Dark colors are more protective and are preferred. A tightly woven fabric and dry protects better than loosely woven cloth or wet clothes.
Some clothings are available to special UV protection. These sun-protective clothes may have a label listing the UV protection (UPF) value that ranges on a scale of 15 to 50 and over. The higher the UPF, the higher the protection from UV rays. Swimming costumes are available with UV protection. Some new laundry detergents may also increase the UV protection of clothing.
Babies less than 6 months of age should be kept out of direct sunlight and protected from the sun using hats and protective clothing.

Sunscreens
The next important step is to use sunscreen. This is the most vital step in sun-protection. It is important to know the level of protection offered by a sunscreen. Sunscreens are available in many forms like lotions, creams, ointments, gels, sprays, wipes etc. Some are available in cosmetics as well including powders, foundation, lipsticks etc.
Most dermatology associations, including the American Academy of Dermatology, recommend using broad-spectrum sunscreen products which help protect against both UVA and UVB rays. These have a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30. The SPF number is the level of protection the sunscreen provides against UVB rays.
When applying a SPF30 sunscreen, it should be smeared on thickly to get approximately 1 minute of UVB rays for each 30 minutes spent in the sun. SPF 15 sunscreens filter out 93% of UVB rays, while SPF 30 sunscreens filter out 97%, SPF 50 sunscreens 98%, and SPF 100 filters around 99% of the UVB rays.
Ideally 1 ounce of sunscreen (around one palm full) should be used to cover the arms, legs, neck, and face of the average adult. Most sunscreens must be reapplied at least every 2 hours and more frequently if one is swimming or sweating. Waterproof sunscreens protect for 80 minutes while those that are not protect for 40 minutes.
Sunscreens that contain avobenzone (Parsol 1789), ecamsule, zinc oxide, or titanium dioxide protect from both UVA and UVB rays. Sunscreens past their expiry date may still be effective to a lesser extent for 2 to 3 years. Before use the bottle needs to be shaken to remix the sunscreen ingredients.
Some individuals are allergic to products used in sunscreens. To check for allergies a small amount can be applied over the soft skin on the inside of the elbow. If the skin does not turn red or itchy, the product is suitable for the individual.

Using a hat
A hat with at least a 2- to 3-inch brim all around is best protection against the sun. It can protect the ears, nose, forehead, and the scalp. Hats with a non reflective and dark underside also help to lower the amount of UV rays reaching the face from reflections of water, sand and snow. A cap like a baseball cap with about 7 inches of fabric over the sides and back also protects the face and neck.

Sunglasses
UV-blocking sunglasses protect the eyes and the soft skin around them. Sunglasses with UV protection should block 99% to 100% of UVA and UVB radiation. Labels that say “UV absorption up to 400 nm” or “Meets ANSI UV Requirements” mean 99% blockage of the UV rays.
Cosmetic glasses block about 70% of UV rays. Large-framed and wraparound sunglasses are more protective. Some contact lenses also block UV rays but these do not cover the whole eye and do not provide enough protection when used alone.
Tanning beds and artificial sunlamps should be avoided
Tanning lamps give out UVA and usually UVB rays as well. These can seriously harm the skin and cause skin cancer. Tanning bed use has been linked with an increased risk of melanoma especially if used by young adults (less than 30) and adolescents.
Several tanning pills claim to give a tan without exposing a person to UV radiation. These mostly contain color additives similar to beta-carotene. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve any of these products for tanning.
Routine self skin examination
Routine self skin examination is another important measure for detection of any skin changes or changes in moles, scars, marks, blemishes, freckles early. If detected early most skin cancers are easier to treat.

    'What is Skin Cancer?', 
    'Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States. Almost all skin cancers are the result of too much exposure to ultraviolet light. This is found in sunlight, tanning booths, and sunlamps. Skin cancer is usually one of the most curable types of cancer.
Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are two of the most common forms of skin cancer. They are very curable. These cancers occur in the basal and squamous cell layers at the top of the skin. They are almost always slow-growing. If found early, they are easy to treat and do not spread.
Melanoma is a less common but aggressive form of skin cancer. It occurs in skin cells that make a skin color pigment called melanin. If it is not found early, it will likely spread to other tissues. It can spread through the whole body and may cause death. Only 2% of skin cancer cases are melanoma. But it causes the most deaths from skin cancer.

Symptoms of skin cancer
The main symptom of skin cancer is a new or changing bump, growth, lesion, mole, or rough patch of skin. Not all skin cancers look alike.
A normal mole is solid tan, brown, dark brown, or flesh colored. Its edges are well defined. It’s usually smaller than 1/4 inch in diameter. It has a round or oval shape. It is flat or dome-like.
The ABCDE rule can help you remember what to look for when you’re checking for moles. If you notice any of these signs, talk to your doctor right away.
- A for asymmetry – Mole is not symmetrical. This means it’s not the same on both sides. If it was folded in half, the two halves wouldn’t match.
- B for border –Edges of the mole are blurry or jagged.
- C for color – Changes in the color of a mole. This could be darkening, loss of color, spreading color, or multiple colors.
- D for diameter – A mole more than ¼ inch in diameter.
- E for evolving – Mole looks different from others or is changing in shape, size, or color.
Other signs of cancer could include:
- A mole that itches or bleeds.
- A fast-growing mole.
- A scaly or crusted growth on the skin.
- A sore that won’t heal.
- A patch of skin that has changed color.
Most skin cancers occur on parts of the body that are repeatedly exposed to the sun. For men, these areas include the head, neck, face, tips of the ears, hands, forearms, shoulders, back, and chests. For women, they occur most commonly on the back and the lower legs.
Melanomas can be anywhere on your body. In men, they are most often on the chest, stomach, or back. In women, they are most often on the lower legs.
Moles also can grow in hidden areas of your body. This include between toes, on your scalp, or under a nail. If you notice a mole that has changed, or if you have a new mole that doesn’t look like your other moles, see your family doctor right away.

What causes skin cancer?
Most cases of skin cancer are caused by too much exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This comes from the sun, tanning beds, and sunlamps. There are 2 types of UV rays:
- UVA rays (long-wave) –UVA rays penetrate clouds and glass. They penetrate the skin more deeply and damage the basal layer of the skin.
- UVB rays (short-wave) –UVB rays damage the upper layers of the skin. They are the main cause of tanning and sunburn.
Researchers used to believe that only UVB rays led to cancer. But studies have shown that both UVA and UVB damage the skin and can cause cancer.
A tan is the body’s attempt to protect itself from the sun’s harmful rays. Even if you don’t burn, being in the sun too often for too long can lead to skin cancer.
Tanning booths are just as dangerous as long periods of sunlight.
Some people are more at risk of developing skin cancer. Things that could increase your risk include:
- Having fair skin, blonde or red hair, and light-colored eyes.
- Long-term sun exposure, such as working outside.
- A history of bad sunburns, especially as a child or teenager.
- Using indoor tanning beds.
- Having a weakened immune system, including having an organ transplant.
Melanoma can occur anywhere on your body. This includes places that aren’t exposed to the sun. So there could be other factors that can cause it. Risk factors for developing melanoma include:
- Someone in your family has had cancerous moles or a melanoma.
- You have many moles larger than a pencil eraser.
- You have more than 50 moles of any size.
- You got a bad sunburn that caused blisters when you were a child.
- Your skin usually burns but doesn’t tan.

How is skin cancer diagnosed?
The first step to diagnosing skin cancer is usually through regular self-examination. Use a full-length mirror and a handheld mirror to check every inch of your skin.
1. Learn where your birthmarks, moles, and blemishes are and what they usually look like. Check for anything new, such as a change in the size, texture, or color of a mole, or a sore that doesn’t heal.
2. Look at the front and back of your body in the mirror. Raise your arms and look at your left and right sides.
3. Bend your elbows and look carefully at your palms and forearms, including the undersides, and your upper arms.
4. Check the back and front of your legs.
5. Look between your buttocks and around your genital area.
6. Sit and closely examine your feet, including the bottoms of your feet and the spaces between your toes.
7. Look at your face, neck, and scalp. You may want to use a comb or a blow dryer to move hair so you can see better.
By checking yourself regularly, you are familiar with what’s normal for your skin. If you find anything unusual, see your family doctor. The earlier skin cancer is found, the better.
Your doctor will examine your skin. He or she will look at the size, shape, color, and texture of any concerning areas. If you have skin changes that might be skin cancer, your doctor will do a biopsy. During a biopsy, a small piece of your skin is removed and sent to the lab for testing.
If skin cancer is diagnosed, you may undergo more tests to see if the cancer cells have spread. These tests could include a CT scan, MRI, or lymph node biopsy.

Can skin cancer be prevented or avoided?
The key to preventing skin cancer is to avoid being in the sun or using sunlamps. If you’re going to be in the sun for any length of time, follow safe-sun guidelines. These are ways to protect your skin and reduce your risk of skin cancer. For the best protection, follow all of these guidelines every time you’re outside.
1. Avoid the sun.
Avoid being in the sun in the middle of the day, between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. The sun is the strongest during these hours. That’s when the most damage to your skin occurs. Sunburns and suntans are signs that your skin is damaged. The more damage, the more likely you are to have complications. These include early wrinkles, skin cancer, or other skin problems.
2. Use sunscreen.
Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. Use it on cloudy days, too. Check the expiration date. Some ingredients break down over time. Use plenty of sunscreen. Rub it in well. Apply sunscreen at least 15 minutes before you go into the sun. Apply the sunscreen everywhere your skin is exposed. This includes your ears, the back of your neck, and any bald areas on the top of the head. Apply more sunscreen at least every 2 hours and after swimming, sweating, or toweling off.
Remember, you’re not completely safe just because you’re wearing sunscreen. Sunscreen cannot give you 100% protection against the sun’s harmful UV radiation.
3. Wear a wide-brimmed hat, protective clothing, and sunglasses.
If you have to be out in the sun, cover up your skin. A wide-brimmed hat will help protect your face, neck, and ears. A hat with a 6-inch brim all around is the best. Baseball caps don’t protect the back of your neck or the tops of your ears.
Wear protective clothing, such as long-sleeved shirts and long pants made of tightly woven fabric. If the clothes fit loosely, you will feel cooler. Special sun-protective clothes are available from several companies.
Wear sunglasses to protect your eyes. Sun exposure increases your risk of getting cataracts. Choose sunglasses that protect the sides of your eyes and block both UVA and UVB rays.
Remember that you are exposed to the sun while driving, especially your hands and arms. Clouds and water don’t protect you. UV rays can reach swimmers at least 1 foot below the surface of the water, and 60% to 80% of the sun’s rays go through clouds. The sun’s rays also can reflect off water, snow, white sand, and concrete.
4. Don’t try to get a tan.
Don’t use tanning beds or sunlamps. They damage your skin just like natural sunlight does.
5. Protect your kids.
Sunburns in childhood are the most damaging. Children younger than 6 months of age should never be outside in direct sunshine. Children 6 months of age or older should wear sunscreen every day. Getting numerous bad sunburns as a child increases your risk of developing skin cancer later in life.
The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) advises talking to children, teens, and young adults, who are 10 to 24 years of age, about the dangers of too much sun exposure. Teach them how to protect themselves and reduce their risk of skin cancer.

Skin cancer treatment
Treatment for skin cancer depends on several factors. These include the type of cancer, where it is located, how big it is, how far it has spread, and your general health. Most cases of nonmelanoma cancers can be taken care of with surgical removal of the mole or lesion. Other options include freezing, medicated creams, or laser therapy.
Treatment for melanoma is more complex. When caught early, the cancerous tissue can be removed with surgery. If it has spread beyond the skin, treatments could include:
Radiation – High-energy rays like X-rays shrink or kill the cancerous cells.
Chemotherapy – Powerful medicines, in pill form or injected into the veins, shrink or kill the cancer.
Biological therapy – Uses substances produced by living organisms. These can be made in the body or in a lab. They are used to boost your immune system to help your body fight the cancer. Some may suppress your immune system. This means you could more easily get sick.
Targeted therapy – Uses medicines that are designed to target specific weak spots in cancer cells.

Living with skin cancer
Skin cancer is treatable, especially when caught early. Cancerous tissue can be removed with a minor surgical procedure. In many cases, that is all the treatment needed. Future lesions may occur. You will need to continue checking your skin. Call  your doctor if you see changes.
For more advanced cases, living with cancer during treatment can be stressful. Each treatment can have different side effects on your body. Take good care of yourself. Eat a healthy diet, get plenty of sleep, and try to keep your energy up by staying active.
Even after your cancer goes into remission, you are at higher risk of cancer returning to your body. You will need to get regular follow-up care and check-ups for years after your treatment.

Questions to ask your doctor
- What should I look for when I do a self-examination of my skin?
- I have a mole that’s getting bigger. Could it be skin cancer?
- I spent a lot of time in the sun as a child. Should I be checked for skin cancer regularly?
- My father had skin cancer. Am I more likely to have it, too?
- I have darker skin. Can I still get skin cancer?
- How quickly does my type of skin cancer grow and spread?
- Do I have an increased risk of additional skin cancers?
- Should I see a skin cancer specialist?',

    'Survival Rates for Different Types of Skin Cancer', 
    'Skin cancer is the abnormal growth of skin cells. It’s a common cancer that can form on any part of the body, but it often occurs on sun-exposed skin.
The sun’s ultraviolet (UV) rays can damage the DNA in your skin cells over time, resulting in the growth of cancerous cells.
Anyone can get skin cancer, but some things can increase a person’s risk. Risk factors include having:
- lighter skin
- a history of sunburns
- a personal or family history of skin cancer
- Skin cancer survival rates vary depending on the type of cancer. Some types of skin cancer are life-threatening when not treated early, while others have a low death rate.

Types of skin cancer
The four most common types of skin cancer include:
1. Melanoma
Melanoma is skin cancer that forms in melanocytes. These are the skin cells that produce melanin, a pigment responsible for skin color.
Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer, but it’s also a less common type.
Melanoma skin cancer usually presents as a brown or black spot that’s larger than a mole.
The spot or bump can have an irregular border and shades of different colors. The bump might be reddish in color with black, blue, or purple spots mixed in.
Melanoma can develop anywhere on the body, such as the:
- chest
- back
- legs
- soles of the feet
- underneath the nails

2. Basal cell carcinoma
Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer. It accounts for more than 80 percent of skin cancer diagnoses.
It forms in the basal cells and is found on parts of the body heavily exposed to the sun. Although basal cell carcinoma grows slowly and doesn’t usually spread to surrounding areas, it can be life-threatening if left untreated.
Symptoms of basal cell carcinoma include:
- flat white or yellowish area
- raised red patches
- pink or red shiny bumps
- pink growths with raised edges
- open sore that doesn’t heal

3. Squamous cell carcinoma
Squamous cell carcinoma also has a low death rate. It’s slow-growing and can develop on the:
- face
- neck
- back
- chest
- ears
- back of the hands
Symptoms include:
- rough, scaly red patches
- raised bumps or lumps with a slight indentation in the center
- open sores that don’t heal
- wartlike growths

4. Merkel cell carcinoma
Merkel cell carcinoma starts in the Merkel cells. These are located below the top layer of skin near the nerve endings.
It’s an aggressive type of skin cancer that’s difficult to treat, but it’s rare. It’s more likely to occur in people older than 50 and those with a weaker immune system.
Merkel cell carcinoma is fatal if it spreads to the brain, lungs, liver, or bones.
An early sign of Merkel cell carcinoma is a fast-growing flesh-colored bump or nodule that may bleed. Nodules can also be red, blue, or purple.

Stages of skin cancer
If you receive a skin cancer diagnosis, the next step is to identify its stage.
Staging is how doctors determine whether the cancer has spread to other parts of your body. Staging is common with melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma, because these cancers are more likely to spread.
Typically, basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas don’t involve staging. These skin cancers are easily treated and don’t usually spread. However, your doctor may recommend staging for larger lesions.
Staging is based on the size of the growth and whether it has high-risk features. High-risk features include:
- larger than 2 millimeters thick
- spreads into the lower levels of the skin
- spreads into the space around a nerve
- appears on the lips or ears
- appears abnormal under a microscope
Here’s a general breakdown of skin cancer stages:
- Stage 0. The cancer hasn’t spread to surrounding areas of the skin.
- Stage 1. The cancer is 2 centimeters (cm) across or less, with no high-risk features.
- Stage 2. The cancer is more than 2 cm across and has a least two high-risk features.
- Stage 3. The cancer has spread to the bones in the face or nearby lymph nodes.
- Stage 4. The cancer has spread to the lymph nodes or internal organs.

Skin cancer survival rates
The outlook, or survival rate, for skin cancer depends on the type of skin cancer and stage of cancer at diagnosis.
Typically, the earlier you receive a diagnosis with skin cancer, the better your outcome. Cancer is harder to treat once it spreads to other parts of the body.

Melanoma survival rate
Melanoma is a deadly cancer when it spreads, but it’s curable in its early stages.
The five-year survival rate for melanoma stages 0, 1, and 2 is 98.4 percent, according to the Melanoma Research Alliance.
The five-year survival rate of stage 3 melanoma is 63.6 percent. It’s 22.5 percent for stage 4 melanoma.

Merkel cell survival rate
According to the American Cancer Society, the five-year survival rate for Merkel cell stages 0, 1, and 2 is 78 percent. It’s 51 percent for stage 3 and 17 percent for stage 4.

Basal cell and squamous cell survival rates
Because basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas are lower-risk skin cancers, there’s little information on survival rates based on stage.
Both types of cancer have a very high cure rate. According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the five-year survival rate for basal cell carcinoma is 100 percent. The five-year survival rate for squamous cell carcinoma is 95 percent.

Skin cancer prevention
Skin cancer is a very preventable cancer. Here’s how to protect yourself when outdoors:
- Use sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 or higher. Follow product instructions and reapply as needed.
- Wear sunglasses.
- Wear a wide-brimmed hat to protect your face, head, ears, and neck.
- Wear pants and long sleeves to protect your arms and legs.
- Stay in the shade when possible.
- Avoid indoor tanning.
- Avoid the sun during the middle of the day when it’s at its strongest.
- Tell your doctor of any new skin growths or changes to moles, bumps, or birthmarks.

What to do if you receive a skin cancer diagnosis
Once a skin biopsy confirms skin cancer, your doctor will recommend a treatment based on the stage of the cancer.
To improve your outlook, it’s important that you complete your treatment and schedule follow-up appointments as needed. Your doctor may want to see you every few months to make sure the cancer hasn’t returned.
Also schedule annual skin exams with a dermatologist. Get into the habit of checking your own skin for abnormal growths, too. This includes your back, scalp, soles of feet, and ears.
You can also ask your doctor about local support groups for those with skin cancer, or search for support programs in your area.

Takeaway
Depending on the type, skin cancer can grow rapidly and become life-threatening if not treated early.
Talk to your doctor if you have any new growths on your skin or notice changes to an existing mole, bump, or birthmark.
Skin cancer has a high cure rate, but only if caught early.

    'Risk factors for skin cancer', 
    'The primary risk factor for melanoma and non-melanoma cancers is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, including sunlight and tanning beds, with the risk growing with the amount of exposure. People who live in areas with bright, year-round sunlight, or those who spend a lot of time outdoors without protective clothing or sunscreen, are at greater risk. Early exposure, particularly for people who had frequent sunburns as a child, also increases skin cancer risks.
Reducing factors under your control may help lower your risk of skin cancer, including melanoma. Regular skin examinations may help identify a developing skin cancer early, when it is most treatable.
Common skin cancer risk factors include:

General
Age: Skin cancer risks increase as you age, which is likely due to accumulated exposure to UV radiation. But skin cancers may also be found in younger individuals who spend a lot of time in the sun. Frequent sunburns, especially when they occurred during childhood, increases the risk of developing melanoma.
Immune suppression: Conditions that weaken the immune system, such as viruses, diseases or immune suppression therapy associated with organ transplantation, may increase skin cancer risks.
Gender: Men are approximately two times more likely to develop basal cell carcinomas and three times more likely to develop squamous cell carcinomas than women.

Body
Skin tone: Caucasians have a greater risk of developing skin cancer than non-whites. The risk is also higher in individuals with blond or red hair, blue or green eyes, or skin that burns or freckles easily.
Moles: Most moles are harmless and may never develop into cancer, but having a large number of moles may increase the risk for developing melanoma. The presence of dysplastic nevi (moles that may resemble melanoma) may also increase risk, by 10 percent. Although most dysplastic nevi will not develop into melanomas, a small percentage may, and individuals with these types of moles should see a dermatologist regularly for thorough skin exams.

Genetics
Family and/or personal history: Individuals with one or more parents or siblings with skin cancer may be at increased risk. Individuals who have previously been diagnosed with skin cancer are also at increased risk for developing the disease again.
Inherited conditions: Conditions such as xeroderma pigmentosum, an inherited disease that affects the skin’s ability to repair UV damage, are at increased risk for developing skin cancers, and may develop them at an earlier age.

Lifestyle
Smoking: Smokers are more likely to develop squamous cell skin cancers, particularly on the lips.
Chemical exposure: Certain chemicals, including arsenic, industrial tar, coal, paraffin and certain types of oil, may increase the risk for certain types of non-melanoma skin cancers.
UV exposure: People who work outdoors during the day or who choose to spend much of their leisure time outdoors and are exposed to UV light are at an increased risk. People who choose to use tanning beds increase their risk of skin cancer.

Other conditions
Basal cell nevus syndrome: Individuals with this condition, also known as Gorlin syndrome, often develop many basal cell carcinomas over their lifetimes, and these may start before they are 20 years old.
Viruses: Certain types of human papilloma virus (HPV) infections, particularly those that affect the anal or genital area, may increase the risk of skin cancer. Individuals have a higher risk of Kaposi sarcoma if they were infected with what’s known as the eighth human herpesvirus, also called Kaposi sarcoma associated herpesvirus. According to the American Cancer Society, some patients with Kaposi sarcoma have a weakened immune system because of their HIV infection.

Previous treatment
Radiation exposure: Treatment with radiation may increase the risk for developing skin cancers in the exposed area.
Psoriasis treatment: Individuals who have been treated for psoriasis with a combination of psoralen, a natural remedy, and ultraviolet light treatment may have an increased risk for developing squamous cell carcinoma and other forms of skin cancer.',
